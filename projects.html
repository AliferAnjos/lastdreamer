        This will allow you to stay AFK (Away From Keyboard) without getting your screen blocked.</br>

        <p>Instructions:</p>
        
        <p>Start button to start the moving of your mouse cursor. The button will change color on "Running Mode".</br>
        Stop button to stop de movement, one click is enough, but it won't be displayed a button pressed movement.</br>
        In case of crash, finish the program on your task manager!</br>
        The Linux Version might run on macOS, but was not tested yet.</p>
